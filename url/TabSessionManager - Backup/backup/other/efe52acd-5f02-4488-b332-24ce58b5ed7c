By tk.variopower About 24,335 monthly listeners A Finnish post-punk outfit based out of Helsinki, Grave Pleasures deliver both hooks and horror via a macabre -- and danceable -- mix of apocalyptic punk, metal, pop, and goth-rock that invokes names like Fields of the Nephilim, H.I.M., the Cure, and Bauhaus. The band was founded in 2010 after the dissolution of vocalist Mat McNerney and bass player Valtteri Arino's previous project, the like-minded Beastmilk, who released an EP and a well-received full-length before ceasing operations. Citing influences like David Bowie, Magazine, and Wire, the quintet, which also includes Juho Vanhanen, Aleksi Kiiskilä, and Rainer Tuomikanto, issued their debut album, Dreamcrash, in 2015 via Columbia and Metal Blade. The group inked a deal with Century Media for the release of their sophomore studio long-player, 2017's Motherblood. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi On tour NOV 10 Ascension Festival Iceland 2021 Wed 9:00 PMHlégarður, Reykjavík Offers DOOMSDAY ROADBURN Vinyl Record Protection Each record is protected within its record sleeve by a white vellum anti-dust sleeve.
